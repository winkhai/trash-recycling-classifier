# trash-recycling-classifier
**Sorting images into different types of trash and recycling (glass, paper, cardboard metal, plastic, trash).**

This project was inspired by my mentor [Ryan Lambert](https://github.com/Ryanglambert) and the [latest news](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/702501726/where-will-your-plastic-trash-go-now-that-china-doesnt-want-it) on the world recycling business that is now banned by the Chinese government. Recycling contamination is a major issue; it is very labor intensive and expensive especially when recyclable items (ie. plastic bottles) are contaminated with other waste materials. Automated waste sorting will alleviate some of these issues.

This project will utilize an image dataset collected manually by [Gary Thung and Mindy Yang](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet). The dataset can be found in Gary's Repo.

The zipped file is also available in this repo.
